      <h2>The Title Pranksters</h2>

      Hello, welcome to The Title Pranksters!
      
In this studio, we change the title to create a cool effect on your follower's "What's Happening" section on the Front Page. 
(｡  )-♡
⸻
| ᴡʜᴀᴛ ᴛʜɪꜱ ꜱᴛᴜᴅɪᴏ ɪꜱ:
 -A place to prank others via the title
 -A place have some laughs
 -A place to add relevant "prank" projects
(⌒∀⌒)

| ᴡʜᴀᴛ ᴛʜɪꜱ ꜱᴛᴜᴅɪᴏ ɪꜱɴ'ᴛ:
 -A place to set disrespectful or inappropriate titles
 -A place to advertise
 -A place to ask/do F4F or Follow-On-Request
 -A place to request to curate/manage (We're not looking for curators/managers!)
(╥﹏╥)

| ʜᴏᴡ ɪᴛ ᴡᴏʀᴋꜱ:
1.) ᴠɪᴇᴡ ᴛʜᴇ ᴛɪᴛʟᴇ ᴛᴇᴍᴘʟᴀᴛᴇ:
"[your username] is now following [title]" 
— This is how studio follows show up in the "What's Happening" section on the Front Page

(i.e, [LegoManiac04] is now following [you to Mars])

2.) ᴄᴏɴꜱɪᴅᴇʀ ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜʀ ɪᴅᴇᴀ ꜰɪᴛꜱ:
Does your title fit the template above? Does it make sense? How original is it? Most importantly, is it respectful and appropriate?

3.) ꜱᴜɢɢᴇꜱᴛ ɪᴛ:
We get many requests every day, so every title can never be selected. Be patient, and repost your suggestion(s) every so often if you'd like.

4.) ꜰᴏʟʟᴏᴡ:
If your title is set, or you find the current title funny, follow the studio, and enjoy your confused followers!
